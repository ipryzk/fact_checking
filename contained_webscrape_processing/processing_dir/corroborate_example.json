        "text": "Then, we proposed and developed a phage-delivered resistance eradication with subsequent antibiotic treatment (PRESA) strategy. The removal efficiency and antimicrobial effect of the plasmids were analysed. Long-term antimicrobial effect was evaluated by continued OD600 monitoring for 240 hours to illustrate the potential mutational resistance, compared with the lytic phage strategy. The treatment effect of PRESA was evaluated in vivo by determining bacterial loads in the skin and intestine of infected mice, in contrast with lytic phage therapy. Genome sequencing was performed to identify mutations in bacterial cells treated with phage strategies. Results: Phage-delivered targeting efficiently eradicated and blocked the transfer of the antibiotic resistance plasmid. PRESA decreased the bacterial load by over 6- and 5-logs in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Importantly, while lytic phages induced mutational phage resistance at 24 h in vitro and 48 hours in vivo, PRESA demonstrated a constant effect and revealed no resistant mutants. Genes involved in DNA mismatch repair were upregulated in cells undergoing Cas9-based plasmid cleavage, which may reduce the development of mutations. Conclusion: strategy for eradicating resistant bacteria showed high bactericidal efficacy and a sustained inhibition effect against resistant bacteria. By restoring the efficacy of low-cost antibiotics, PRESA could be developed as an efficient and economical therapy for infections of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Keywords: Antimicrobial resistance, Phage delivery system,Cas, Phage genome recombination, Phage therapy antibiotic resistance has become a serious threat to human health [1-3]. Superbugs, such as blaNDM- or mcr-possessing pathogens, have developed resistance against carbapenems or polymyxins, which are considered antibiotics of last resort [4-9]. Unfortunately, the development of new classes of antibiotics has not kept pace with clinical demand. Thus, novel antimicrobial techniques defending against bacterial drug resistance are urgently needed. Lytic phages are considered a promising strategy for combating antibiotic resistant bacteria as they are natural and effective predators of bacteria. The use of lytic phages against bacteria resistant to antimicrobials has revealed potent treatment effects [10, 11]. However, phages that kill bacteria directly by cell lysis or cytotoxicity always result in bacterial phage-resistance. This resistance develops because of the emergence of mutant bacterial clones [10, 12]."

        "text": "The phage-resistant mutants become predominant under the selection pressure of phage activity, which leads to a rapid loss of the bactericidal effectiveness of lytic phages [13-15]. Thus, particular lytic phages cannot provide long-term and stable bactericidal effectiveness [16]. In recent years, temperate phage-delivered clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat ()/Cas (PDC) strategies have been developed to combat bacteria resistant to antimicrobials. /Cas cassettes are integrated in the genome of temperate phages to eradicate resistant bacteria by lethal chromosomal DNA cleavage or resistance-encoding plasmid removal [17-20]. Although the idea of combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria via RNA-guided nuclease targeting is intriguing, previous studies of chromosome targeting strategies have shown limited therapeutic effects; only a 102 to 103-fold decrease in bacterial load has been observed [17, 18]. Essentially, modified temperate phages that cause lethal double strand breaks (DSBs) in the bacterial chromosome can be considered as a type of lytic phage. However, they are far less effective than native lytic phages since lytic phage therapies require no genome recombination process and have shown reliable therapeutic potential [15, 21]. A resistance-encoding plasmid targeting strategy has been shown to sensitise resistant bacteria in vitro [20]. However, whether this strategy can be utilised to eradicate resistant bacteria is yet to be evaluated, especially using in vivo assays. Eradication of bacterial resistance can restore sensitivity to common antibiotics. In this study, we used aCas9 system for targeting and eliminating resistance-encoding plasmids and presented a PDC-based strategy with potent antimicrobial efficacy. For efficient delivery, we designed a one-step engineering method to integrate theCas9 system, capable of efficiently destroying NDM-1-encoding plasmids that mediate resistance against carbapenems within the genome of a novel temperate phage. The plasmid elimination and bacterial sensitising efficacy of PDC were then determined using both in vitro and in vivo assays. Next, the efficacy of this phage-delivered resistance eradication with subsequent antibiotic treatment (PRESA) strategy for eradicating resistant bacteria was evaluated. targets resistant bacteria without phage-induced cell lysing activity, it has the potential to prevent the rapid development of bacterial phage resistance."

Subsequently, the vB_365 prophage, pSTk plasmid and pKD46 plasmid were successively introduced into the E. coli MG1655 host strain, providing the necessary enzymes for homologous recombination. Next, the dsDNA donor, containing the specificCas9 cassette from pCas9-N1 and homologous arms, was transformed into the cells by electro-transformation. /Cas9 system integrated within the prophage genome could be directed to the target-PAM sequence and eliminate the suicide plasmid via an RNA-guided nuclease, enabling cell survival.

Next, a combined strategy against resistant E. coli, involving phage-induced sensitisation and kanamycin treatment, was tested (Figure 2C). The bactericidal efficiency of this strategy increased with increasing multiplicity of infection (MOI); > 6-log reduction in colony forming units (CFUs) was detected at a MOI of 102. In total, nine E. coli host strains were transformed with pUCtargetk to test the plasmid elimination effect of the modified phage. The bacterial sensitisation effect was confirmed for all of these host strains. Furthermore, the combined strategy could block the spread of resistance by preventing the distribution of the responsible plasmids. Specifically, the transfer of pNDM-1 from Acinetobacter XM1750 to E. coli J53 was inhibited by the intervention of the modified phage. We further analysed the accumulation of resistance genes in the bacterial supernatant during the killing of the resistant strain. To highlight the advantages of PDC, the modified phage was compared with lytic E. coli phage clone vB_ 253. The bacterial supernatant of each group (5 \u00ce\u00bcL) was filtered. Plasmid contained in the supernatant was transformed into E. coli DH5\u00ce\u00b1 competent cells.

The surviving bacterial cells in PRESA and lytic phage groups were separated at 96, 144, 192, and 240 h. A phage plaque test was used to confirm that the MG1655 cells in the vB_253 group had acquired phage-resistance after receiving the lytic phage strategy while cells in the combinatory treatment group had not (Figure S6).

Five of the seven sequenced clones (253R1, 253R2, 253R3, 253R4, and 253R5) contained mutations in fepA (Figure 6A), including SNV (253R1: 943A>G, 253R3: 2197G>T), insertion (253R2: 844_845insT), and deletion (253R4: 462_477del253R5: 512delG). The fepA gene encodes the FepA protein, which is the ferric enterobactin outer membrane transporter involved in phage absorption as a recognition receptor [23]. The kanamycin-resistant mutant showed a unique mutation in fusA (Figure 6B), which encodes protein chain elongation factor EF-G."

These phage- or kanamycin-resistance related mutations above, as well as other mutations in several common phage receptor genes and membrane protein genes (lamb, ompA, ompC, ompF, phoE, phuA, tonB, waaB, btuB), were not observed in the sequence of E. coli clones treated with PRESA. The expression of DNA mismatch repair genes at the mRNA level was examined using RT-qPCR (Figure 6C). Transcription of a number of genes (mutS, mutT, polB and dnaE) was upregulated in MG1655 cells receiving Cas9-based plasmid eradication, compared with phage- or kanamycin- resistant clones.

(C) Expression of genes involved in DNA mismatch repair (mutS, mutT, polB and dnaE; n = 3, mean \u00c2\u00b1 SD). concept of utilising genetic technology to combat antibiotic resistant bacteria has attracted substantial attention [24, 25]. In this study, we evaluated a strategy for combating resistant bacteria using a combination of -based sensitisation and conventional antibiotic treatment. This strategy restored the efficacy of low-cost drugs and efficiently eradicated resistant E. coli cells without the emergence of new resistance against PRESA. Temperate E. coli phage was engineered using our novel method to integrate the -Cas9 system within its genome. A negative screening system was designed based on combining the suicide gene sacB and the target sequence. This screening system was introduced into homologous recombination to replace the traditional screening system based on resistance markers [26]. It guaranteed that temperate phages can integrate with a functionalCas9 system within one recombination step without any resistance residue in its genome."

        "text": "In addition, false positive recombination, such as mutations in theCas9 cassette [18], could be precluded. Then the highly functionalCas9 system was efficiently delivered to the target and destroyed the bacterial resistance plasmid, yielding > 99. 99% clearance rate of the target plasmid in 8 h. Plasmid removal not only eradicated the antibiotic resistance of E. coli cells, but also prevented the spread of bacterial antibiotic resistance. Plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer of drug-resistance was blocked by PDC. In contrast, lytic phages killed the bacterial cells but led to the dissemination of intracellular antibiotic resistance plasmids in the bacterial environment. These plasmids are possible to be taken up by co-harboured strains, resulting in the emergence of new resistant strains [27-31]. Therefore, direct killing of resistant cells might increase the risk of horizontal transfer of resistance factors in bacteria-rich environments, such as the human intestine, hospital surfaces, and livestock farms [32, 33]. Thus, plasmid targeting by PDC is not only expected to offer a novel alternative for resistant bacterial infections but will also aid in blocking the transfer of antibiotic resistance. Owing to efficient target plasmid elimination and bacterial sensitisation, kanamycin sensitivity was restored and could be used to treat resistant E. coli. strategy yielded a potent antimicrobial effect against resistant E. coli and the bacterial load decreased by 6 logs in vitro and 5 - 6 logs in the mouse skin or intestine infection models, showing a greater bactericidal effect than in previous studies [17, 18]. Our results indicate that plasmid targeting strategy has the potential to facilitate antibiotic treatment of resistant bacteria in the future. Some antibiotic resistance genes are located in the bacterial chromosome, which is not suitable for using the PRESA strategy. However, according to previous studies, our modified phage can also be utilised to cleave chromosome-encoded antibiotic resistance genes, leading to bacterial cell death. There were concerns about the possibility that the temperate phage-based strategy could spread antibiotic resistance or virulence genes by phage delivery [34]. In our assessment, the risk is low because when treating bacterial infections, the combined use of antibiotics can eradicate the strains receiving phage-induced transduction and sensitisation."

        "text": "Most importantly, eradication of bacteria using PRESA did not lead to mutational resistance, which is always observed using lytic phage treatment. In addition to acquired antibiotic resistance mediated by mobile plasmids, emergence of mutational antimicrobial resistance is another threat during bacterial infection treatment. Direct killing strategies are more likely to result in the selection of resistant mutants [34]. Various studies have demonstrated that the efficacy of phage antimicrobials is rapidly compromised because of the development of bacterial resistance against the phage [35-38]. In most cases, phage resistance arises owing to changes in receptors on the bacterial cell membrane, resulting in the absence or modification of phage receptors [15]. Selection pressure exerted by lytic phages leads to the predominance of resistant mutants and the recovery of bacterial growth [39]. Our results demonstrate that new bacterial resistance against lytic phage vB_253 rapidly developed by 12 h in vitro. Genome sequence analysis revealed that the occurrence of mutations in the fepA gene was closely related to this phage resistance. The outer membrane protein, FepA, participates in the adsorption of ferric enterobactin and also functions as the receptor of some phages [23, 40]. exhibited persistent efficacy against antibiotic resistant bacteria. No mutations were found in fepA or other phage receptor-associated genes. In fact, our engineered temperate phage did not kill bacterial cells through repeated lytic life cycles but efficiently disarmed bacterial cells following infection. Thus, temperate phages carrying theCas9 system do not trigger the selection of phage resistance and can sustain longer effectiveness compared with lytic phages. Antibiotic often lost sensitivity because of the occurrence of mutational antibiotic resistance [41]. Our results indicated that even the sensitive MG1655 strain developed new resistance against kanamycin after treating with kanamycin for three days in vitro. Sequence analysis discovered mutations in the fusA gene in the genome of kanamycin-resistant mutant clones. The fusA gene encodes the translation elongation factor EF-G; mutations in this gene are responsible for the development of kanamycin-resistance [42, 43]. Surprisingly, our results suggest that the PRESA strategy prevents the formation of mutational kanamycin-resistance. This phenomenon might be associated with the nuclease activity ofCas9."

        "text": "It has been reported that double stand breaks in bacterial DNA result in the activation of the DNA repair mechanisms [44]. Indeed, RT-qPCR analysis showed that the transcription of DNA mismatch repair-related genes was increased after E. coli cells underwent targeted plasmid cleavage. The rise of gene mutations associated with drug resistance could be suppressed due to the activation of DNA mismatch repair mechanisms. Further research is still needed to reveal the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon. strategy exhibited a potent effect against resistant bacteria and prevented the re-emergence of new antibiotic or phage resistance. Further development and application of this strategy could provide a solution for the antibiotic resistance crisis. Also, this research illustrated the benefit of the combined use of novel phage strategy and conventional antibiotics. Previous studies have shown that phage-resistance often leads to a decrease of bacterial fitness or antibiotic resistance [36, 37]. These findings provide increasing evidence that phage-based therapy may become a solution for bacterial resistance. A limitation that needs to be addressed is the narrow host range of phage. Utilising broad-host range phages or a cocktail strategy may solve this problem. Advances in nano-materials may also provide new solutions toCas9 delivery [45, 46]. With better delivery systems, a -based bacterial sensitisation strategy could be extensively applied in clinical treatment, and well-established antibiotic therapies could become effective once again in treating drug-resistant infections. this study, we demonstrated that the PRESA strategy effectively eradicated resistant bacteria by restoring the efficacy of conventional antibiotics. This strategy shows higher efficacy than previously reported -based antimicrobials. Importantly, unlike the lytic phage strategy, PRESA exhibited a continuous inhibitory effect against resistant bacteria, without the emergence of new mutational resistance. Thus, the efficacy of low-cost antibiotics could be restored in bacterial infection treatment. Finally, we believe that PRESA can be further developed as a promising therapy to address the antibiotic resistance issue. thank Jiang W. , Bikard D. , Cox D. , Zhang F. , and Marraffini L.
